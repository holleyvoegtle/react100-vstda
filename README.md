# Very Simple To Do App

The purpose of this project was to build a simple ToDo app in React where the user enters a todo item in a text box and chooses the priority of the item. Once the todo item is added, a "View Todos" section is populated. In this section, the user can delete the item, check it off, or edit. The edit icon drops downs where you can edit the item and re-prioritize it. Once the changes are saved, the user is returned the the list of todos.

While creating this app, certain types of data were used to control a component. This is where props and state.props were used due to the nature of multiple files being used. Composng application in React is about breaking up the user interface into small reusable components.

The first thing that was done in creating this app was to plan out the User Interface (UI) hierarchy as well as the User's Experience (UX). Then a wireframe was created for the application structure in order for a comprehensive breakdown of the components. After everything was created and working, tests were performed using the provided test file. After it all passed, the app was deployed to [Heroku](https://hvtodoapp.herokuapp.com/)
